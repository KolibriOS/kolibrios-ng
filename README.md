# Kolibri OS

__Kolibri__ is a very tiny and incredibly fast operating system

## Overview

The speed and compactness is achieved due to the fact that the kernel and most programs are written in the __FASM__ assembler, thereby optimized for __x86__ processors as much as possible. Only 8 megabytes of RAM is enough to run

__Kolibri__ separated from __MenuetOS__ in 2004, and since then has been developed by an international community of programmers. Work is underway to make life easier for developers and users
